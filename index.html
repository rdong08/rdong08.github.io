                <p>I obtained my bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Shandong University in 2011. Subsequently, I embarked on my Ph.D. journey in computational biology under the guidance of Dr. Li Yang at the Partner Institute for Computational Biology (PICB) in Shanghai. During my Ph.D. research, I am focusing was on the evolution and functions of long non-coding RNAs, with a particular emphasis on circular RNAs (circRNAs).
In 2018, I joined Guo-Cheng Yuan's lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where I honed my expertise in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Later, in 2020, I joined the lab of M.D. Miguel N. Rivera at the Massachusetts General Hospital. In my current role, I am actively engaged in developing advanced algorithms and integrating multi-omics data to gain deeper insights into the gene regulation of cancer biology.

            <h3>Epigenetics in Cancer</h3>
            <p>We have undertaken a comprehensive characterization of the functional roles played by EWSR1 fusion transcription factors in mediating long-distance chromatin interactions and regulating gene expression in the context of Ewing Sarcoma and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors. Furthermore, our investigations have revealed that EWS-FLI1 can promote oncogenesis by orchestrating the activity of other transcription factors, such as NFIB, through its intrinsically disordered regions.

            <h3>Single Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics</h3>
            <p>I have been dedicated to the development of GiniClust3, a powerful tool designed for large-scale single-cell datasets to identify rare cell clusters. Additionally, I have also developed SpatialDWLS, a highly accurate tool tailored for cell type decomposition in lower-resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets.
